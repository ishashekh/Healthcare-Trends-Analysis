# Healthcare Trends Analysis: Weekly Cumulative Influenza Vaccine Doses Distributed in the United States

## Project Overview

This project aims to analyze the trends in the distribution of influenza vaccine doses across different weeks in the United States. By leveraging data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), this analysis identifies high-risk regions and visualizes the past data on vaccine distribution. The insights generated from this project can be beneficial for public health officials and policymakers to enhance vaccination strategies and address areas with lower vaccine uptake.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this analysis is sourced from the CDC API and contains information on the cumulative doses of influenza vaccines distributed by season, month, and week. Key features of the dataset include:

- `season`: The influenza season during which the data was collected.
- `month`: The month in which the vaccine doses were distributed.
- `week`: The week number corresponding to the month.
- `cumulative_flu_doses`: The cumulative number of influenza vaccine doses distributed up to that week.

## Analysis Objectives

The primary objectives of this project are:

1. **Identify High-Risk Regions**: Determine areas with low vaccine distribution to target public health interventions effectively.
  
2. **Visualize Past Data**: Create visual representations of cumulative influenza vaccine doses over time to identify trends and patterns in vaccination efforts.

3. **Generate Insights**: Provide actionable insights that can aid in public health decision-making and resource allocation for influenza vaccination programs.

## Visualizations

This project includes various visualizations to illustrate the trends in vaccine distribution:

- **Cumulative Flu Vaccine Doses Over Weeks**: A line plot showing the trend of cumulative doses distributed over different weeks, categorized by season.
  
- **Weeks with Lowest Flu Vaccine Distribution**: A bar plot highlighting the weeks with the lowest reported vaccine distribution, helping to identify critical periods for intervention.

## Conclusion

This Healthcare Trends Analysis project demonstrates the importance of data analysis in public health. By understanding vaccination trends, stakeholders can implement targeted strategies to improve vaccine distribution and ultimately enhance public health outcomes during influenza seasons.
